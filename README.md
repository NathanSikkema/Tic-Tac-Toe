This project took me 8 days to code. It really could use some major changes to make it more efficient, but since it's one of the first, I think it's neat to look back and see how much I've improved since.

### Special Features:
 - Multiplayer
 - 5 different levels of difficulty
 - Instruction Manual
 - Colored titles and Menus (if ran with a compatible terminal)
